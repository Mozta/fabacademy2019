											<p>3D printing has the following principle:  a digital model is turned into a physical three-dimensional object by adding material a layer by layer.</p>
											<p>This way of creating objects is different way of producing parts compared to traditional subtractive (CNC machining) or formative (Injection molding) manufacturing technologies.</p>
											<p>In contrast to the other forms of producing pieces, in 3D printing no extra tools are required to cut or mold, in this case, the piece is manufactured directly on the platform built layer by layer, this allows us to create complex parts.</p>
										</div>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/week06/ulti0.png" alt="" /></span>
									</div>

									<div class="content">
										<p>To be able to print a piece in 3D, it is necessary to have the 3D model created in some CAD software and then upload the file to the printer software, which divides the model into thin and two-dimensional layers and then converts it into a set of instructions in machine language (G code) for the printer to execute.</p>
										<p>There are different types of 3D printing:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><p class="my-color">Material Extrusion (FDM):</p> Material is selectively dispensed through a nozzle or orifice</li>
											<li><p class="my-color">Vat Polymerization (SLA & DLP):</p> Liquid photopolymer in a vat is selectively cured by UV light</li>
											<li><p class="my-color">Powder Bed Fusion (SLS, DMLS & SLM):</p> A high-energy source selectively fuses powder particles</li>
											<li><p class="my-color">Material Jetting (MJ):</p> Droplets of material are selectively deposited and cured</li>
											<li><p class="my-color">Binder Jetting (BJ):</p> Liquid bonding agent selectively binds regions of a powder bed</li>
											<li><p class="my-color">Direct Energy Deposition (LENS, LBMD):</p> A high-energy source fuses material as it is deposited</li>
											<li><p class="my-color">Sheet Lamination (LOM, UAM):</p> Sheets of material are bonded and formed layer-by-layer</li>
										</ul>
										<p>The available materials also vary by process. Plastics are by far the most common, but metals can also be 3D printed.</p>
										<p>Next, I list some pros and cons</p>

										<p>For this practice I decided to go deeper into Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM).</p>
										<p>It works in the following way, a spool of filament is loaded into the printer and then fed to the extrusion head, which is equipped with a heated nozzle. Once the nozzle reaches the desired temperature, a motor drives the filament through it, melting it.</p>
										<p>The printer moves the extrusion head, laying down melted material at precise locations, where it cools and solidifies (like a very precise hot-glue gun). When a layer is finished, the build platform moves down and the process repeats until the part is complete.</p>
										<p>After printing, the part is usually ready to use but it might require some post-processing, such as removal of the support strucures or surface smoothing.</p>

										<p>3D printing plastics are lightweight materials with a wide range of physical properties, suitable for both prototyping purposes and some functional applications. Next, I list some materials.</p>
										<ul>
											<li><p class="my-color">PLA:</p> High stiffness, good detail, affordable. PLA is a biodegradable thermoplastic for low-cost, non-functional prototyping. Greater detail than ABS, but more brittle. Unsuitable for high temperatures.</li>
											<li><p class="my-color">ABS:</p> Commodity plastic, improved mechanical and thermal properties compared to PLA. ABS is a common thermoplastic with good mechanical properties and excellent impact strength, superior to PLA but with less defined details.</li>
											<li><p class="my-color">Resin:</p> High detail and smooth surface, injection mold-like prototyping. Resins are thermoset photopolymers that solidify when exposed to light, producing high detail parts with a smooth, injection mold-like surface finish.</li>
											<li><p class="my-color">Nylon:</p> Used to substitute functional injection moulded parts, good chemical resistance. Nylon or polyamide (PA) is a thermoplastic with excellent mechanical properties, high chemical and abrasion resistance. Perfect for functional applications.</li>
											<li><p class="my-color">PETG:</p> Good for mechanical parts with high impact resistance and flexibility. Sterilizable. PETG is a thermoplastic with improved properties over PLA, with high impact resistance and excellent chemical and moisture resistance. PETG can be sterilized.</li>
											<li><p class="my-color">TPU:</p> Rubber-like material, suitable for tubes, grips, seals and gaskets. TPU is a thermoplastic elastomer with low Shore Hardness and a rubber-like feel that can be easily flexed and compressed.</li>
											<li><p class="my-color">ASA:</p> UV stability and high chemical resistance, preferred material for outdoor applications. ASA is a thermoplastic with properties similar to ABS but with improved thermal, chemical and weather resistance. Perfect for outdoor applications.</li>
											<li><p class="my-color">PEI:</p> Engineering plastic, high performance applications, flame retardant. PEI is an engineering thermoplastic with good mechanical properties and exceptional heat, chemical and flame resistance.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>It is worth mentioning that to start 3D printing is a model in the STL file format.</p>


										<h1>Ultimaker 2+</h1>
										<p>Engineered to perform, the Ultimaker 2+ is reliable, efficient, and user-friendly. Thanks to its support of a wide range of materials, it’s suitable for a huge variety of applications, from prototypes to customized tools. It’s a great all-around 3D printer that delivers consistent results.</p>

											<div class="row gtr-uniform">
												<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/week06/Ultimaker-2-Plus-Product-Overview.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
										<p>Specifications</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Build volume: 223 x 223 x 205 mm</li>
											<li>Filament system: Open filament system</li>
											<li>Optimized for: PLA, ABS, CPE, CPE+, PC, Nylon, TPU 95A</li>
											<li>Layer resolution: From 600 micron, Up to: 20 micron</li>

										</ul>

										<h1>General Design Consideration for 3D Printing</h1>
										<h2>Overhangs</h2>
										<p>Overhangs are areas of a model that are either partially supported by the layer below or not supported at all. There is a limit on the angle every printer can produce without the need of support material. For example, for FDM and SLA this angle is approximately 45o degrees.</p>
										<h2>Wall thickness</h2>
										<p>The second thing to keep in mind when designing a part to be 3D printed is wall thickness. Every 3D printing process can produce accurately features that are thin up to a certain point.</p>
										<p>As a good practice, always add thickness to your models. Walls with thickness greater than 0.8 mm can be printed successfully with all processes.</p>
										<h2>Warping</h2>
										<p>The heating and cooling of material can cause the parts to warp while printing.</p>
										<p>A good practice is to avoid large flat surfaces and add rounded corners to your 3D models.</p>
										<h2>Level of detail</h2>
										<p>The minimum level of detail is connected to the capabilities and mechanics of each 3D printing process and to the selected layer height.</p>
										<p>The process and materials used will have an impact on the speed and cost of your print, so determining whether smaller details are critical to your model is an important design decision.</p>


										<h1>The print</h1>
										<p>In order to verify the limitations of the printer, I got a 3D model to print a piece of torture. In addition, I decided to print it on 3 different printers in order to observe the level of finish of each one.</p>
										<p>The first impression was on the Ultimaker 2+ printer.</p>

										<h1>3D print</h1>
										<p>For this activity, I had to print a piece in 3D that was not subtractive.</p>
										<p>Looking for inspiration and complicating my life, I decided to make retractable tweezers, which had a mechanism that would allow the supports to rotate. Here the main challenge, design that mechanism in one piece. As I was very lost, I looked for inspiration on the internet and found a 3D model of what I wanted to do, upload it to the Cura software which allowed me to see it layer by layer and in this way I understood the mechanism. Take a capture in the Z plane to place it as a reference image. Use the Fusion 360 software to model it.</p>

											</div>
										</div>
										<p>After about 5 hours, my design was printed.</p>
										<div class="box alt">
											<div class="row gtr-uniform">

											</div>
										</div>
										<p>It is worth mentioning that to print my design, with the software cure added supports so that they do not collapse certain parts, which was very good for certain layers, however, in the slot of the hinges added an extra layer which caused these slots to be they could not turn. I will try to open them with a cutter.</p>
										<p>However, taking into account this drawback and following the nature of this type of 3D printing, I plan to reprint the piece with some adjustments and place the model backwards, that is, 180º on the Y axis, in this way these hinges are not they will not clog or collapse by the weight of the other layers.</p>

										<h1>Scan 3D</h1>
										<p>To scan a real-world object and make it digital in a 3D model there are different ways of doing it.</p>
										<p>In this practice we were taught to use laser scanning and photogrammetry.</p>
