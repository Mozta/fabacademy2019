											<h3>Von Neumann architecture model</h3>
										</div>

									</div>

									<div class="content">
										<p>The architecture of John Von Neumann is mainly characterized by processors that have the same storage device for both instructions and data. These, when stored in the same format in memory, uses a single data bus to maintain contact with the CPU. This creates an efficiency in the use of memory, but at the same time requires an ambiguity to be able to recognize and distinguish the data. The computers that use this model are composed by the logical arithmetic unit or "ALU"<p>
										<p>This architecture is a family of computer architectures that use the same device to store as for instructions.</p>
										<p>Computers with the von Neumann architecture consist of five parts: the Logical Arithmetic Unit (ALU), the control unit, the memory, an input / output device and the data bus that provides a means to transport the data between different parts.</p>
										<p>A computer that has this architecture emulates the following procedures:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>When you turn on the computer and get the next instruction from the memory at the address indicated by the program counter and save it in the instruction log.</li>
											<li>Increase the program counter and save it in the instruction register.</li>
											<li>Decode the instruction through the control unit. This is the one in charge of coordinating the rest of the components of the computer to perform each determined function.</li>
											<li>The instruction is executed. This can change the value of the program counter, allowing repetitive operations. The counter can also change when a certain arithmetic condition is met, causing the computer to "think", making it able to reach any degree of complexity through previous arithmetic and logic.</li>
										</ol>

										<p>First we must build a 2D model in some CAD software, in this case I decided to use AutoCad, the assembly of the piece was at a distance of 15mm material. Then the file is exported in .DXF format</p>
										<p>So that the machine can interpret the model, we use the Aspire software, which I had to install on my Macbook using Windows through Bootcamp, since there is no Mac version, a negative point in my opinion.</p>
										<p>After installing it, it was necessary to install the PostProcessor corresponding to the machine we have, Asia Robotics. In this way, when we export it, only the one we will use to export will appear.</p>

										<p>Once the Aspire software is open, we configure the values of our work area, in this case, the size of the wood sheet of 1220mm x 2440mm x 15mm, we move the position of origin XY and accept. Then we import our file and adjust if necessary. The software has basic tools where we can make certain adjustments.</p>
										<p>We select the vectors for engraving, which must be the first thing that the machine has to do, and then we configure the tool that we will use, in this case, the 1/4-inch bit. We generate the roads and simulate in 3D, the same software allows it.</p>
										<p>After doing the engraving, we precede to make the cuts or drawer, it is worth mentioning that to make assemblies it is recommendable to use backbones, in this way in the corners the tool will be a little more, generating a small circle inwards that will allow us to piece that fits reaches the bottom and makes a good connection.</p>

												<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/week08/3.PNG" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
										<p>Finally, we export our files, selecting the appropriate Post Processor and save. In our case we first save the file for engraving and then the cut file and save it in an usb.</p>
										<p>With the files in the usb, we proceed to connect it to the machine. Although before that, we must place our wooden plate on sacrificial bed placed in the machine. Then we adjust the plate to the base with the help of small presses, in this way we ensure that it does not move.</p>

											</div>
										</div>
										<p>In the machine we adjust the values X, Y and later Z, to be able to locate it we approach the closest to the plate and then slightly adjust the tip of the tool to touch the wood. Then we upload the file we need and proceed to execute the process.</p>

										<blockquote>
											We must be cautious and have security measures, wear a gown, some protective glasses and boots.
										</blockquote>

										<p>When I finished the engraving, we lifted the tool and proceeded to change the tip for the cutting. And we continue with the process. The result was the following.</p>

												<p>For this project, I decided to do something for my pet, a little rabbit, so I wanted to make a house, I was thinking about the design and decided not to follow the classic square houses, so I made my design based on an equilateral triangle.</p>
											</div>
										</div>

										<div class="content">
											<p>Take as a reference the measure of the lying rabbit, so that it could lie down without space problems, so it is longer than wide. Then I show my sketch, and first I draw it in pencil before going directly to the CAD.</p>

												</div>
											</div>
											<p>After landing the idea of my design, I proceeded to draw it in AutoCad, where I traced my lines, established constraints and made the parametric design. Here are some photos of the process.</p>

											<p>When I finished the drawing in AutoCad, before going to cut my pieces, I had a little uncertainty in case my pieces or assemblies did not fit very well, so I decided to do a simulation, turning my 2D drawing into a 3D design and assembling the pieces . For that I wanted to use a new software for me, so I used Rhino. Create a new file and import my 2D model, then select my pieces and extrude to 15mm. It was here that I found my first error, a piece did not extrude correctly because there were double lines and unconnected points, ie open vectors, so I had to return to AutoCad to modify that piece, export again in DXF and import into Rhino.</p>
											<p>After correctly extrude the parts of my model, I turned and moved the pieces to achieve an assembly, here I found the second error, the walls did not assemble correctly, that is, having these walls at an angle of 60º, the cut of the assembly generated a spacing that was not aesthetically correct, in addition to that height stood out too much, so I had to make some adjustments from AutoCad.</p>
											<p>Once I finished doing the simulation correctly, I proceeded to save my files in an usb and change operating system to use Aspire.</p>

												</div>
											</div>
											<p>In Aspire, configure the parameters necessary for my design and try to generate the trajectories, however, the walls marked error, since there were still open vectors and, although the Aspire software has a tool for joining open vectors, it did not work. I had to go back to AutoCad and modify it. This procedure was a headache, since I tried it in several ways and did not generate the paths correctly. However, after so much frustration I managed to make my design correctly and Aspire was able to generate the paths correctly.</p>

											<p>Export my file to be able to take it to the router, in this case it was only one of cutting. It should be mentioned that the cut in general was with the cut outside the line, but for the assemblies and circles of the triangles (front and back) were inside, thus ensuring that the spacing was the size of the material of 15mm. Save the file in an usb and proceed to download to the router machine to make my cut.</p>
											<p>Below I show the process of this great feat.</p>

											<p>When the pieces came out, I proceeded to sand them to remove splinters and give a better finish and then began to assemble, after several hours of work, it was a great satisfaction when the pieces were perfected.</p>

											</div>
											<p>Finally, I wanted to make an engraving, so I designed in Illustrator a vector of my rabbit standing on 2 legs, with his name on one side, Emmett II.</p>
											<p>This technique could have done it in the same router but because of the finish, consider that it would be more professional in the laser cutting machine, than better to apply the different techniques learned.</p>
