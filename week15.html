										<p>For this assignment we had to design, build and connect several wireless or wireless nodes with network or bus addresses in order to create a network that would allow communication between different cards.</p>
										<p>The communication protocols between processors can be of different types, for example the UART, SPI and I2C protocols.</p>
										<h3>UART</h3>
										<p>A universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) is a block of circuitry responsible for implementing serial communication. Essentially, the UART acts as an intermediary between parallel and serial interfaces. On one end of the UART is a bus of eight-or-so data lines (plus some control pins), on the other is the two serial wires - RX and TX.</p>

												<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/week15/uart.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
										<h3>SPI</h3>
										<p>The SPI Bus (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a communication standard, used mainly for the transfer of information between integrated circuits in electronic equipment. The Serial Peripheral Interface Bus or SPI bus is a standard for controlling almost any digital electronic device that accepts a serial bit stream regulated by a clock (synchronous communication).</p>

												<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/week15/spi.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
										<h3>I2C</h3>
										<p>The Inter-integrated Circuit (I2C) Protocol is a protocol intended to allow multiple "slave" digital integrated circuits ("chips") to communicate with one or more "master" chips. Like the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), it is only intended for short distance communications within a single device. Like Asynchronous Serial Interfaces (such as RS-232 or UARTs), it only requires two signal wires to exchange information.</p>

										<p>Below I show a comparative table of these three protocols.</p>

												<p>For the individual assignment I decided to use 2 communication protocols, the UART and the I2C.</p>
											</div>
										</div>

										<div class="content">
											<p>The idea is to use the UART communication to connect the PC to the master card, and use the I2C communication to establish communication between the master card and 2 slave cards, with the purpose of being able to choose which to communicate by specifying which address to send the message. In this way I managed to create a network that merges 2 types of communications, UART and I2C.</p>

											<p>For the group assignment, which was to send a message between 2 projects, I chose to work as a team with my partner Letty, however, we did not have the necessary cards to carry out this task, so we decided to generate a serial production of many cards, so we designed a card with the minimum necessary to make communications.</p>
											<blockquote >
												This helped us both for the group and individual assignment, for the lack of cards.
											</blockquote>
											<p>The idea to send a message from my computer to my partner's, was to join my network created with yours, through the UART protocol. The following image illustrate this idea.</p>
											<div class="box alt">

													<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/week15/redgrupal.jpeg" alt="" /></span></div>
												</div>
											</div>

											<p>In this practice we had an unfortunate problem, in order to make the proposed network we needed more cards, because, until now, the cards we had were insufficient. To solve this dilemma, I decided to design a replicable card to mass produce (so to speak), in this way I could fulfill individual and group practice by cutting several cards.</p>

												</div>
											</div>

											<p>With this design, I joined several in Photoshop and then load them into fabmodules to generate the files to record and cut the pcb in the minimill.</p>

												</div>
											</div>

											<p>Finally I soldered the components and tested the cards. It is worth mentioning that only the cards are designed and each one is in charge of welding and testing their cards.</p>
