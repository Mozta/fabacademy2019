									<div class="content">
										<p>It was a free week, where we had to design and produce something using digital manufacturing processes, some examples could be compositions, textiles, biotechnology, robotics, folfding and kitchen.</p>

										<p>In our fab, we decided to create some jewelry, so in class we were taught a process that involves digital fabrication with casting techniques.</p>

										<p>So the first step was to determine what piece of jewelry to make, in my case I decided to create a pair of rings.</p>
										<p>The first step was to take the measure of ring that my finger needed, fortunately I already had rings with my measurement, so with the vernier I took the measurements of height, width and depth. However, there are certain special rules that jewelers use to get the exact measurement.</p>
										<p>Then I designed my first ring, which I wanted to make in the shape of a skull / helmet. Looking for images on Pinterest I found a ring that I liked a lot so I downloaded the image to try to reproduce it.</p>
										<p>The CAD software I used was Maya 3D, at this stage of the fab, I have learned many CAD softwares but thanks to this I have been able to find the advantages that each one has for the different types of design that you can imagine. In this case, being a more organic model, I was able to design it in Maya.</p>

										<p>To make this design, place the reference image in a plane to try to trace the main vertices and then modify my initial object, a cube.</p>
										<p>Since it is based on a skull, and we take into account that it is symmetrically vertical, I concentrated on only designing one half for when it was finished, only mirroring and joining symmetrically.</p>
										<p>In the end it was only to adjust certain vertices to be able to give a final finish.</p>

										<p>One problem I had was that the design was pretty good but on a single axis, that is, the skull was flat, as if it had been crushed. So I had to change the vertices to achieve a curvature, adapted to the reality of a skull and the circumference of the ring.</p>

										<p>After better adapting the curvature, soften the design so that it does not remain so "lowpoly".</p>
										<p>The detail of the eyebrow was created also from a cube that I was deforming and softening, in the end I adjusted it where I had to go and using a Boolean I managed to create that detail.</p>

										<p>The ring placed so far was simulation, that is, it did not have the real measurements but it facilitated the creation.</p>
										<p>Finally, export the model in .OBJ format, which is a fairly compatible extension between several CADs.</p>

										<blockquote >
											One point to consider is that when designing in Maya you do not have real measurements, only units.
										</blockquote>

										<p>So then I use Rhinoceros CAD software where I design 2 circumferences with the measurements of my ring that I previously obtained. Extruded and then mesh my ring.</p>
										<p>Import the model of my skull and adjust the dimensions to tie the measurements with the ring created in Rhinoceros since this one does have the real measurements.</p>
										<p>Finally, remove the fake ring created in Maya and adjust the skull to the real ring. Export the model in .STL format to be able to print it.</p>

										<p>To make the impression we use a 3D printer different from the ones I normally used in the fab. We are talking about a castable resin printer.</p>
										<p>Next, a little information about it.</p>

										<p>The castable resin is a resin designed to capture precise details and smooth surfaces, it burns cleanly</p>
